# atlas-dashboard

A cross-platform analytics dashboard focused on real-time insights, modular data visualization, and performance-aware UI architecture.

1. Add simulated data sources for development and testing

Description:
Implement mock data providers capable of producing deterministic and variable update patterns to support UI development and performance exploration before integrating real data sources.

2. Document initial design decisions and trade-offs

Description:
Capture early architectural and design choices in the README, including alternatives considered and reasons for rejection, to preserve context as the codebase evolves.

3. Identify potential performance risks in layout rendering

Description:
Review the dashboard layout and rendering pipeline to highlight potential performance bottlenecks, especially under frequent updates or larger widget counts.
